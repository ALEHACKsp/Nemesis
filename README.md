## Usage

Just select whatever you want (Process, Dll, Driver, ...) and click on the dump button. If it was successful, you can load the file into decompilers like [IDA Pro], [Ghidra] or [Binary Ninja]. Some of these programs are available for free but of course they won't be as good as the paid ones. Here's a short list of the different versions:

Paid: 
- [IDA Pro]
- [Binary Ninja]

Free:
- [Ghidra]
- [IDA Freeware]
- [Binary Ninja Demo]

[IDA Pro]: https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/index.shtml
[Ghidra]: https://ghidra-sre.org/
[Binary Ninja]: https://binary.ninja/
[IDA Freeware]: https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download_freeware.shtml
[Binary Ninja Demo]: https://binary.ninja/demo/

> Note: If you want another decompiler added, feel free to create a pull request or issue.

## Memory Sources

### Problem

First of all, there's not really a public driver dumper, so you either had to rely on other people dumping them for you or write a dumper yourself. However, to be able to dump drivers, you need to have a kernel mode driver. It can be really annnoying if you just want to dump a simple process, if you have to load your driver beforehand. 

Of course there's tools which only dump processes with/without a kernel driver, but you'd need to install like 3 different programs just to be prepared for all situations.

### Solution

With Nemesis, you can simply switch memory sources with a single mouse click and use whatever you need. This does not only save you some time, but also a lot of disk space.

If you want to dump it with physical memory or via a hypervisor? Simply add a new memory source and you are good to go.

## Exports

Nemesis is also available as a dump library. If you want to implement a dumper, but don't want to mess with low level stuff, simply load the dll and use the following imports.
