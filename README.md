## Memory Sources

### Problem

First of all, there's not really a public driver dumper, so you either had to rely on other people dumping them for you or write a dumper yourself. However, to be able to dump drivers, you need to have a kernel mode driver. It can be really annnoying if you just want to dump a simple process, if you have to load your driver beforehand. 

Of course there's tools which only dump processes with/without a kernel driver, but you'd need to install like 3 different programs just to be prepared for all situations.

### Solution

With Nemesis, you can simply switch memory sources with a single mouse click and use whatever you need. This does not only save you some time, but also a lot of disk space.

If you want to dump it with physical memory or via a hypervisor? Simply add a new memory source and you are good to go.
